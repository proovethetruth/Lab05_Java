## Task

Write an IMatrix interface with multiple implementations --- UsualMatrix and the  extending it SquareMatirx from previous tasks and SparseMatrix for sparse matrices. SparseMatrix should be implemented using LinkedList (you may need to create some other additional classes that should be nested/extra-nested). All common methods should be represented in the Matrix interface.

Write a program that creates 2 random matrices of size 1000x1000 with 1000 zero elements in each in two ways --- using ordinary and sparse matrices. Check that addition and multiplication for different types of matrices gives the same results.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
